    - The view get the content of the encyclopedia entry by calling the appropriate *util* function.
    - If an entry is requested that does not exist, the user is presented with an error page indicating that their requested page was not found.

    - If the query matches the name of an encyclopedia entry, the user is  redirected to that entry’s page.
    - If the query does not match the name of an encyclopedia entry, the user instead is taken to a search results page that displays a list of all encyclopedia entries that have the query as a substring.
